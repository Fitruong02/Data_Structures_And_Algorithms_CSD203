### PetManagement ###

Assume that we want to build an application that manages a list of birds. Each bird has nickname (string), age (integer), and weight (float). Students are required to build the application supporting functions below:

Tasks	Requirements	
1.	Add a new bird to the list (duplicate nickname is not allowed)	
2.	Display all birds in the list 	
3.	Search a bird by name (returns a list of all birds that have the search string in their nickname)	
4.	Update age and/or weigh of a bird. Nickname can NOT be updated	
5.	Remove the first bird (kept by ‘self._head’ node) from the list	

NOTEs: 
-	Read the test description CAREFULLY
-	Use ONLY pyCharm tool to implement the test questions
-	Apply at least one of these data structures: lists, stacks, queues, trees
-	Do NOT modify the initial code except it is stated that “# Write your code here”
-	Find the line “# Write your code here”, and replace the word “None” by your appropriate Python code
-	Can define new functions, classes to accomplish the test questions
